                <p>On the 21st of January 1996, Marco Asensio Willemsen was born in Palma Majorca, Spain to a Dutch mother, and a Spanish father. Fun Fact Marco's mom chose his name since he was the second child and his father already chose his older brothers name. She named him after a famous English player at the time. </p>
                <p>Marco is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a winger and attacking midfielder for Real Madrid and the Spain national team. He started out playing for small clubs for boty indoor and outdoor soccer teams at the age of 6. As he grew older Marco became a very valuable player in the eyes of every coach he played for. But his journey was not an easy one from suffering from knee injurys and the death of his mother at only 15, Marco fought every step of the way to get here.</p>
                <p>He grew up in a soccer orienated home where every day he would practice and play with his brothers older friends. Asensio featured 23 times over his first season, scoring three times as the club won the national championship for the first time since 2012. He added as many goals in that year's UEFA Champions League, including one in the final against Juventus F.C. (4â€“1) to give the Spaniards their 12th title in the latter competition.</p>
